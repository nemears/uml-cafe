# Open-UML

Hey everyone! This is a modeling client for uml still in development. It is based off of the wonderfully quick and simple [uml-cpp](https://github.com/nemears/uml-cpp) and [uml-user-service](https://github.com/nemears/uml-user-service) as a back end. It also uses [uml-js](https://github.com/nemears/uml-js) to help communicate to the backend.

The goal of this is to have a free to use modeling client that is modern and open-source. The app should help current modelers save lots of money once mature.

## Try it out!
The app is hosted here:
